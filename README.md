# Bounty Hacker | Write-up (THM)
![bounty](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/428cc711-bae3-4c47-9f96-a7135bbe2c1c)

## Enumeration
#### First step in almost every box, running an ```nmap``` scan.
```
sudo nmap -T4 -p- -A (ip)
```
#### After reviewing the results of the nmap scan, we can point out some useful findings:
1. anonymous access to ```FTP``` on port 21
2. HTTP page and Apache 2.4.18 server on port 80
3. ```SSH``` on port 22

## HTTP
#### After reaching this page in the browser we saw this:
![page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4c9e5cc-49f2-4f90-8391-32000b842dc1)
#### This page is useful anecdotally, but there's really nothing we can use later, except for some names as potential ```usernames```.

#### I used ```Gobuster``` to check for any login pages, but nothing was helpful.
```
gobuster dir -w (wordlist) -u (url)
```

## FTP
#### ```Nmap``` scan showed us that ```anonymous FTP login is allowed```, so why not use it.
```
ftp (ip)
```

#### We see two files, ```locks.txt``` and ```task.txt```
#### All we need to do now is read the files, so let's use the ```get(filename)``` command and read them to our machine.
#### The first file gives us a set of passwords and ```task.txt``` is some tasks written by ***

## Brute-Force:
#### Let's put these names on the web page into a file that includes the name we found in ```task.txt``` and call it ```user.txt```.
#### Since we only have ```ssh```, the next step we need to do is run ```hydra``` to force ```ssh``` login to use the password list which is ```locks.txt```.
```
hydra ssh://ip -L users.txt -P locks.txt
```

#### Now we got credentials and can log in ```ssh``` and read ```user.txt```

## SSH
#### letâ€™s login using ```ssh``` !

## Privilege Escalation and Root flag
#### Trying to get to root is impossible at the moment because we are currently just the user *** himself.
#### Letâ€™s run ```sudo -l``` to see what the user can run as another user or root

#### It can be seen that we can run tar as root.
#### Go to [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) and search for ```tar```

```
sudo tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null â€” checkpoint=1 â€” checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh
```

#### Letâ€™s grab this flag !! ðŸš©

#### That's all about this machine. Enjoy hacking!
